## Ideas

### Random lil guys

- #### hot reload with docker
- Have admin as a role, not as a boolean on user objects!
- Timestamp should be `createdAt`

### Product decisions

- have a book form on the homepage
- show what everyone is currently reading / most recently reading, and their last activity date
- user sessions / roles / permissions (oof)
- Book lookup (bLookup) using a web service
- Reviews (stars, optionally text)
- admin dashboard ?
